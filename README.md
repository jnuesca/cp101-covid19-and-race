### Project Description

It is a well known saying that viruses do not discriminate. However, we hypothesize that there is a disparity amongst race and class when it comes to the impact of virulent diseases. Our project assesses this through a case study of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impacts on communities of color and low-income communities. For the purposes of our study, we look at the percent of positive COVID-19 tests and its relationship with median income, race, and job types in New York City. We aim to examine the quantitative relationship between these variables in the context of the societal factors that contribute to this disparity.
